              Hello! My background is in neuroscience, philosophy, and design, now
              studying CS to thread everything together! I'm so proud of this project
              from conception to delivery. My side endeavor these days is building an
              interactive personal blog where I vent about how all of my sufferings come
              from the fact that the human perception of time is a fusiform.
